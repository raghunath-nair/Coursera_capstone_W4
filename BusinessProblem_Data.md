# Venue for opening a new Ice Cream Shop in Bangalore - A Study
## Coursera Capstone Project


###Introduction:  
A Business development consultant has been tasked to make recommendations to a Venture Capitalist on opening a new Ice Cream shop in Bangalore. 
The client would like a neighbourhood with other Indian Restaurants, but a location having no (at least not too many) competition ice cream bars in the area
The notebook provides an exploratory data analysis and visualizations to eventually come to a recommended location(s).

###Data:
The data to be used for this project consists the Foursquare location data for the City of Bangalore. More precisely the dataset would use the following features for exploratory data analysis and necessary machine learning involved.
Neighborhood,Neighborhood Latitude, Neighborhood Longitude,Venue,Venue Latitude,Venue Longitude,Venue Category.

This idea can be extended to explore other Venue Categories in other cities too, although in this project we are primarily interested in an Ice Cream shops in Bangalore
